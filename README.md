Database Management Project
===========================

Project Description
-------------------

In this project, I created a program that retrieves data from MS Access databases using a library. The application implemented CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, and also included the ability to fetch queries from the database and use them on the backend.

The frontend is built using React with the Mui library, and the requests to the server are made using Axios. The backend is written in Node and Express.

Features
--------

*   Connects to MS Access databases using a library
    
*   Implements CRUD operations for managing data
    
*   Retrieves and executes queries from the database on the backend
    
*   Frontend developed with React and Mui
    
*   Backend implemented with Node and Express
    
*   Uses Axios for making server requests
    

Getting Started

1.  Clone the repository:

2. Install dependencies:

3.  Configure the database connection:
    
    *   Update the necessary connection details in the backend code to connect to your MS Access database.
        
4.  Start the development server:
